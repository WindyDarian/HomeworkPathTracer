1.SAH:

raytracing/bvhnode.h

Referenced p217 of physically based rendering 2nd edition
I divide each node into several buckets and estimate costs to split from
each bucket then choose the minimum one as the split plane.

2.Image-Wide Stratified Sampling:

raytracing/samplers/imagewidestratifiedsampler.h

min_distance for n*n sampler as 1/(2n),
MIN_TRIES for each sample is 4, return point with max distance to other all points
for each sample among the 4~100 tries

(If the 100th(MAX_TRIES) attempt still have a distance to all other samples
greater than min_distance then the point with the max distance in the 100 tries
 will be returned)

To calculate the min distance to all other samples in the image:
 I constructed the sample grid in column major order from top-left to
 bottom-right, so for each sample I only needs to check distance with points
 satisfying one of these requirements:
  1) samples in the current pixel;
  2) samples in the right side (<min_distance to right edge) of the left pixel;
  3) samples in the bottom side (<min_distance to right edge) of the upper pixel;
  4) samples in the bottom-right of the upper-left pixel
  5) samples in the top-right of the down-left pixel

预先知道的一点是，Many Spheres 用窝的方法会导致很多不能分割的东西所以
